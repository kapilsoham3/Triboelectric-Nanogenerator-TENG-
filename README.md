# Triboelectric-Nanogenerator-TENG-
I created a generator that uses wind energy and static electricity to generate a small voltage with a group of people, capapble of powering small devices that require really low voltage. This was made using environmentally friendly scrapp materials like toilet paper rolls, tape, wooden block, a metal rod and cardboard cutout. We chose this design so that it's resourceful and easy to recreate. 

# My Role
In this project, I was responsible for helping with the design, brainstorming the materials to use and making the project with the other members. 

# How it works
The wind energy, moves the cardboard cutout and toilet paper design. One material from one end of the electrostatic series (teflon) is stuck to the moving rotationary part and the other end of the electrostatic series (aluminum) was attatched to the wooden base. As the part rotates, the teflon and Aluminum Foil continues to make contact at high speeds, generating static charge. This causes two electrodes to form, and the difference in the charge between the two materials, causes a small potential difference which can be used to power low voltage electronic devices.
